# Hiven.js Roadmap

This is a rough draft of a roadmap for the near future of hiven.js

I want to move the method for creating a room from `House.createRoom()` to `HouseRooms.create()` I will probably do this in the next few commits.

I also want to move all the stores over to a collection like system for better handling of the data and functions on the data.
